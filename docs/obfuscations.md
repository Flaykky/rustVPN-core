# obfuscations.md: dpi evasion mechanisms
is this markdown file, will be network analysis of dpi works in diffrent countries with censorship (mainly Russian)

## history of DPI-blocks in Russia since 2012

## info of currently dpi-blocks in Russia
In Russia, Roskomnadzor (RKN) has been blocking VPNs and VPN protocols from 2022 to 2025. Currently, the following are in use:
1. Wireguard2quic obfuscation by mullvadVPN
2. Vless + Reality
Technologies like goodbyedpi/zapret (with interference) also work.

UDP-over-TCP obfuscation (transmits Wireguard UDP traffic over TCP) and Shadowsocks previously worked.

They are blocking/have blocked: the most popular VPN protocols, YouTube, Discord, Twitter (x), Meta services except WhatsApp, they have blocked Viber, they are attempting to block Cloudflare, they have tested blocking Telegram and WhatsApp, and the entire international internet, they have blocked Telegram and WhatsApp calls. Roskomnadzor's actions also affect both Russian websites and services that have not violated the law, such as banking apps and Steam. A law was recently passed imposing fines for searching for extremist content. The penalty increases under the following condition: using a VPN when searching, although it's unclear how they'll detect what was Googled through a VPN. ISPs are also required to collect what a person has Googled and whether they're likely using a VPN. Mobile internet is also being periodically shut down in all regions except Moscow, leaving only a whitelist of sites like VK, Yandex, and other pro-government websites. Roskomnadzor has also decided to block the IP servers of the most popular hosting providers (AEZ, etc.).
